============================================================



===================BUG#1============================



Steps to Produce/Reproduce
: Run the unit test "testVillageFunc". The bug is also observable when the game is run, resulting in overwhelming victories for
				player zero.
Expected Results: The number of actions added for the Village card is equal to 2. 



Actual Results: The number of actions actually added is 22.
Workarounds: The game still plays if the card is included, although incorrectly. If the card is simply removed, it will not affect overall gameplay, other 
		than the village card being unavailable
Fixes: Change the actions added from 22 to 2, on line 768.



===================BUG#2============================



Steps to Produce/Reproduce
: Run the unit test "testSmithyFunc"
Expected Results: The smithy card should add 2 cards to the player's hand
Actual Results: The card adds 3 cards to the player's hand
Workarounds: The game still plays if the card is included, although incorrectly. If the card is simply removed, it will not affect overall gameplay, other 
		than the village card being unavailable.
Fixes: Change the "i <= 3" in the for loop to "i < 3", on line 750
